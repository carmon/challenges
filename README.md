Past Coding challenges Museum repository
========================================

Some of the coding challenges that I made in the past, recompilated here for the curious eye.

Not looking for work at the moment but if you're a dev maybe you'll find here some of the basic 
challenges that I made for entering in an interviewing process. 

I'll be honest, I prefer having them all together instead of having to make a new repo everytime.

Company names have been removed.

**If you are a Github employee**, you might want to check [my previous repository for this](https://github.com/carmon/temp-challenge), it 
keeps getting a HTTP 500 error and I may never will see it again :sob:.

I made a `git-export` bash script to migrate everything from different cloned repositories.

Bye.
