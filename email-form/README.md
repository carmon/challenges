# ████████ Frontend dev coding challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), as asked in the challenge's PDF. 

It was done in 3 hours.

I didn't quite finish and I'm not fully satisfied with the result, some changes I'll add if I had to make another iteration:

- Buttons and icons as you send them :)
- Dropdown is not horizontally adjusted (x axis or left for CSS savvy) to user input, as seen on figma files
- There is a bug in current icons, 'X' is not showing properly on wrong emails
- CSS could be better (visually, tecnically is OK)

Thank you for your time checking this, you can check a working version of this online [here](https://email-form-challenge.vercel.app/).

How to use:

- Start typing and look for your desired email in the list
- If you know or want to force email, press Enter
- If you want to erase last entry, press Backspace
- For erasing any entry, use X button
